# Problem 1

# Problem 2

The Mr. Trash Wheel data set is imported using `read_excel`. As the
excel file contains multiple sheets of data, the first sheet is read,
and a range is provided to only include data and omit figures/graphics,
empty cells and the final row, which is not dumpster-specific. This is
piped to `janitor::clean_names()` .

The `janitor::clean_names()` function is used to convert the column
names into snake_case for ease of use later. This is piped to
`mutate()`.

The `mutate()` function is used to modify the sports_balls column. In
this case rounding to the nearest whole numbers and then changing the
variable class to integer. It is also used to create a new column,
“trash_wheel”, which will keep track of the original data source when
combined with the professor trash wheel sheet. Finally, the class of
year is changed to double from character.

``` r
mr_trash_wheel<-
  read_excel("./Data/Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", 1, range = "A2:N549") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(
    sports_balls = as.integer(round(sports_balls)),
    
    trash_wheel = c("mr"),
    
    year = as.double(year)
  )
head(mr_trash_wheel)
```

    ## 6        6 May    2014 2014-05-20 00:00:00        2.71        13    1430    2140

    ## #   homes_powered <dbl>, trash_wheel <chr>, and abbreviated variable names

This same process is repeated below for professor trash wheel.

``` r
prof_trash_wheel <-
  read_excel("./Data/Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", 2, range = "A2:M96") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(
    trash_wheel = c("prof")
  )
head(prof_trash_wheel)
```

    ## # A tibble: 6 × 14

    ## 4        4 February  2017 2017-02-26 00:00:00       3.72      15    8590    1030
    ## 5        5 February  2017 2017-02-28 00:00:00       1.45      15    7830    9950
    ## 6        6 March     2017 2017-03-30 00:00:00       1.71      15    8210   10340

    ## #   trash_wheel <chr>, and abbreviated variable names ¹​weight_tons,
    ## #   ²​volume_cubic_yards, ³​plastic_bottles, ⁴​polystyrene

Finally the data sets are combined using `bind_rows()`. Summary
statistics needed are calculated using a series of piped functions to
`summarise()` .

``` r
trash_wheel_tidy <- bind_rows(mr_trash_wheel, prof_trash_wheel)

trash_wheel_tidy %>% 
 group_by(trash_wheel) %>%
  summarise(
    weight_sum = sum(weight_tons),
  )
```

    ## # A tibble: 2 × 2
    ##   trash_wheel weight_sum
    ##   <chr>            <dbl>
    ## 1 mr               1748.
    ## 2 prof              190.

``` r
trash_wheel_tidy %>%
  filter(year == 2020) %>%
  group_by(trash_wheel) %>%
  summarise(sports_balls_sum = sum(sports_balls))
```

    ## # A tibble: 2 × 2
    ##   trash_wheel sports_balls_sum
    ##   <chr>                  <int>
    ## 1 mr                       856
    ## 2 prof                      NA

The data contains 641 observations and 15 variables. Key variables
include *dumpster*, which lists the dumpster number, *year* and *date*
variables, *weight_tons* (weight collected in tons)and
*volume_cubic_yards*. There are also variables the break down the type
of trash collected at each instance.

The total weight of trash collected by Professor Trash Wheel is 856
tons. The total number of sports balls collected by Mr. Trash Wheel in
2020 is 856.
