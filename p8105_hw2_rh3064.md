# Problem 1

# Problem 2

The Mr. Trash Wheel data set is imported using `read_excel`. As the
excel file contains multiple sheets of data, the first sheet is read,
and a range is provided to only include data and omit figures/graphics,
empty cells and the final row, which is not dumpster-specific. This is
piped to `janitor::clean_names()` .

The `janitor::clean_names()` function is used to convert the column
names into snake_case for ease of use later. This is piped to
`mutate()`.

The `mutate()` function is used to modify the sports_balls column. In
this case rounding to the nearest whole numbers and then changing the
variable class to integer. It is also used to create a new column,
“trash_wheel”, which will keep track of the original data source when
combined with the professor trash wheel sheet. Finally, the class of
year is changed to double from character.

``` r
mr_trash_wheel<-
  read_excel("./Data/Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", 1, range = "A2:N549") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(
    sports_balls = as.integer(round(sports_balls)),
    
    trash_wheel = c("mr"),
    
    year = as.double(year)
  )
head(mr_trash_wheel)
```

    ## #   homes_powered <dbl>, trash_wheel <chr>, and abbreviated variable names

This same process is repeated below for professor trash wheel.

``` r
prof_trash_wheel <-
  read_excel("./Data/Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", 2, range = "A2:M96") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(
    trash_wheel = c("prof")
  )
head(prof_trash_wheel)
```

    ## #   ²​volume_cubic_yards, ³​plastic_bottles, ⁴​polystyrene

Finally the data sets are combined using `bind_rows()`. Summary
statistics needed are calculated using a series of piped functions to
`summarise()` .

``` r
trash_wheel_tidy <- bind_rows(mr_trash_wheel, prof_trash_wheel)

trash_wheel_tidy %>% 
 group_by(trash_wheel) %>%
  summarise(
    weight_sum = sum(weight_tons)
  )
```

    ## # A tibble: 2 × 2
    ##   trash_wheel weight_sum
    ##   <chr>            <dbl>
    ## 1 mr               1748.
    ## 2 prof              190.

``` r
trash_wheel_tidy %>%
  filter(year == 2020) %>%
  group_by(trash_wheel) %>%
  summarise(sports_balls_sum = sum(sports_balls))
```

    ## # A tibble: 2 × 2
    ##   trash_wheel sports_balls_sum
    ##   <chr>                  <int>
    ## 1 mr                       856
    ## 2 prof                      NA

The data contains 641 observations and 15 variables. Key variables
include *dumpster*, which lists the dumpster number, *year* and *date*
variables, *weight_tons* (weight collected in tons)and
*volume_cubic_yards*. There are also variables the break down the type
of trash collected at each instance.

The total weight of trash collected by Professor Trash Wheel is 190
tons. The total number of sports balls collected by Mr. Trash Wheel in
2020 is 856.

# Problem 3

The pols-month data is read in via `read_csv`. `separate()` is used to
break the *mon* variable in *year*, *month* and *day*. *month.abb* is a
built-in constant that contains the English abbreviations for the months
of the year, starting from January. The *month* variable is first
coerced into a numeric vector, allowing it to be used inside the
brackets to refer to the corresponding month name (e.g. if the month was
3, it would refer to the third element of *month.name* and be reassigned
to ‘Mar’).

A new *president* variable is created inside a `mutate()` statement
using `case_when()`. The logic inside `case_when()` is only reliant on
the *prez_dem* variable as the *prez_gop* variable has a range of values
from 0-2 (Ford took office in 1974 after Nixon stepped down, resulting
in a value of 2 for Aug-Dec 1974).

Finally, *prez_dem* *prez_gop* and *day* are removed via `select()`.

``` r
pols_month <- read_csv("./Data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/pols-month.csv") %>%
  separate(mon, into = c("year", "month", "day"), sep = "-") %>%
  mutate (
    month = month.abb[as.numeric(month)],
    president = case_when(prez_dem == 1 ~ "dem",
                          prez_dem == 0 ~"gop"),
    year = as.double(year)
    ) %>%
  select(-prez_dem, -prez_gop, -day)
```

    ## Rows: 822 Columns: 9
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## dbl  (8): prez_gop, gov_gop, sen_gop, rep_gop, prez_dem, gov_dem, sen_dem, r...
    ## date (1): mon
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

Next, the snp data set is imported and tidied in a similar manner as
above. `relocate()` is used to reorder the key variables. In this case,
the date variable is formatted as MM/DD/YY, so after separation *year*
will only be a two digit value. In order to correct this, `case_when()`
is used to add 2000 to the *year* if it is \< 50, or 1900 if it is less
≥ 50. The data is then ordered properly for merging with `relocate()`.

``` r
snp <- read_csv("./Data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/snp.csv") %>%
  separate(date, into= c("month", "day", "year"), sep = "/") %>%
  mutate(
    month = month.abb[as.numeric(month)],
    year = as.double(year),
    
    year = case_when(year < 50 ~ 2000 + year,
                      year >= 50 ~ 1900 + year),
    ) %>%
  select(-day) %>%
  relocate(year, month)
```

    ## Rows: 787 Columns: 2
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (1): date
    ## dbl (1): close
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

Next, the unemployment data is imported and tidied. The data is in a
white format, so `pivot_longer()` is used to to turn it into tidy data.
R is case-sensitive, so the *Year* variable will not be seen as the same
key vector as the *year* variable in the earlier data sets. `rename()`
is used to correct this.

``` r
unemployment <- read_csv("./Data/fivethirtyeight_datasets/unemployment.csv") %>%
  pivot_longer(
    Jan:Dec,
    names_to = "month",
    values_to = "unemployment") %>%
  rename(year = Year)
```

    ## Rows: 68 Columns: 13
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## dbl (13): Year, Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

Finally the data sets are joined sequentially. `left_join()` is used in
each instance. snp is joined into pols-month, and then unemployment is
joined into that dataset. The “by=” term is left undefined, so
`left_join()` uses both the *year* and *month* to join the data.

``` r
p3_j1 <- left_join(pols_month, snp)
```

    ## Joining, by = c("year", "month")

``` r
p3_final <- left_join(p3_j1, unemployment)
```

    ## Joining, by = c("year", "month")

pols_month contains 822 observations and 9 variables. It relays the
number of Democratic and Republican governors, representatives and
senators per month per year, as well as if the president at each time
point was Democratic or Republican.

snp contains 787 observations and 3 variables. It relays the closing
value of the S&P index at each time point.

unemployment contains 816 observations and 3 variables. It relays the
percentage of unemployment at each time point.

p3_final contains 822 observations and 11 variables. It is produced by
merging the three data sets above by year and month. At each time point,
it provides the number of politicians, which party controlled the White
House, the S&P closing value and the percentage unemployment. Key
variables include *year, month, president, close* and *unemployment*.
This data set can be used to generally relate the political party in
power with the S&P index (used a representative measure of the economy
overall) and the percentage unemployed.
