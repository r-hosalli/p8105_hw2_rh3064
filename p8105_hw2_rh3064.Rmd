# Problem 1

# Problem 2

The Mr. Trash Wheel data set is imported using `read_excel`. As the excel file contains multiple sheets of data, the first sheet is red, and a range is provided to only include data and omit figures/graphics and empty cells. This is piped to `janitor::clean_names()` , and then assigned to the tibble mr_trash_wheel.

The `janitor::clean_names()` function is used to convert the column names into snake_case for ease of use later.

```{r MrTrashWheel_Import}
mr_trash_wheel<-read_excel("./Data/Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", 1, range = "A2:N550") %>%
  janitor::clean_names()
```
